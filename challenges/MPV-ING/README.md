## Problem statement
Medicine scarcity is one of the most severe problems that Venezuela faces today. Hospitals can go without essential medications like adrenaline, insulin and anaesthetics for months at a time. 

Dr. Julio Castro and his team have been collecting a database of more than 2 million tweets that contain medical supply requests, emergency data, and other indicators. 

We want to keep this data up-to-date and as relevant as possible.

3. Column Data Store
4. Airflow
5. Spanish proficiency is **strongly recommended**.
