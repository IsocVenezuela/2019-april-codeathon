## About the organization

## Problem statement
Medicine scarcity is one of the most severe problems that Venezuela faces today. Hospitals can go without essential medications like adrenaline, insulin and anaesthetics for months at a time.

Dr. Julio Castro and his team have been conducting surveys in hospitals nationwide to keep track of where specific medications are most needed. They have also been collecting a database of more than 2 million tweets that contain medical supply requests, emergency data, and other indicators.

We believe this data, combined, may be used to make informed decisions on where to deploy limited quantities of specific medications brought as humanitarian aid.

## Challenge 

Combine data from tweets and national hospital surveys to decide where to deploy humanitarian aid.
