# Detecting infectious disease outbreaks
Train a model to detect outbreaks of infectious diseases using tweets.

## Problem statement
Venezuela has seen an unprecedented increase in cases of malaria, measles, diphtheria and zika. Since official statistics haven't been published for a long time, it's challenging to keep track of these infectious diseases.

Dr. Julio Castro and his team have been conducting surveys in hospitals nationwide to keep track of where specific medications are most needed. They have also been collecting a database of more than 2 million tweets that contain medical supply requests, emergency data, and other indicators.

We believe this data, combined, may be used to develop a predictive model to detect future outbreaks in real-time, helping to save lives.

## Skills needed
