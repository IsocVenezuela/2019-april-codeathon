## Background

### Who we are

**About Dr. Julio Castro**

Dr. Julio Castro is a Venezuelan doctor and professor specializing in infectious diseases. He is one of the most important activists focusing on the public health sector. Since 2014, when the official data was Dr. Castro and his team gather health statistics using a digital tool that allows them to monitor hospitals across the country.

His work has been widely covered in both national and international media:

**About Medicos por la Salud**

_Medicos por la Salud_ is a network of doctors distributed across the country that has been monitoring hospitals and publishing a yearly report ([Encuesta Nacional de Hospitales](https://www.encuestanacionaldehospitales.com/)) that tries to quantify and communicate the magnitude of the public health crisis in Venezuela.

## Problem Statement

Venezuela has seen an unprecedented increase in cases of Malaria, Measles, Diphtheria and Zika.

Dr. Julio Castro and his team have been collecting a database of more than 2M tweets that contain medical supply requests, emergency data, and other indicators. 

They think this database can be used to quickly detect disease outbreaks in real-time, these reports would otherwise take weeks to go through the official channels making it really hard to react to the outbreaks costing many lives in the process.


## Challenge

*   Tool to visualize in patterns in real-time related to disease outbreaks. For example, when social media tweets in a particular geographical area are showing an abnormal request for malaria-related medications this could imply an outbreak.
*   Develop an ML model that can predict when and where an outbreak has happened based on a database of Tweets provided by Dr. Castro.
