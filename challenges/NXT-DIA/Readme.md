# Venezuelan Diaspora - Solidarity System Indicators

## Who we are
NEXT-STEP is an organization offering a microfinance program, with experience in Venezuela.
The Red Humanitaria de los Caminantes, a network of entities in Colombia provides charity services for the “caminantes” (“walkers”), Venezuelans on the go, emigrating to or through Colombia

## Problem statement
Over 3 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland and are working to get settled in a new country. There is a need to unite, collaborate, meet, and rejoice around everything that is Venezuelan in the countries that they are emigrating. DiasporaVenezuela.app will help Venezuelans in any city to connect to each other and to opportunities. The app will serve as  “Punto de encuentro” (meeting point) for solidarity for Venezuelan abroad.


The app will be developed in a “community” platform and will have four functionalities: events, promotions, job bank, and services. Services list organizations and the services they provide to the community by geolocation. The job bank list both the skills of Venezuelans individuals so they could be found by those that need such services (yellow pages) as well as job offerings (craigslist). Services refers to offers from charities, NGO and other organizations to provide humanitarian and social as well as economic empowerment assistance.
