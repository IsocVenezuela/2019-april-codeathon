This repo contains all the information needed for both in-person and remote participation in the event.

## Before the Event

TODO 

## During the Event

1. **Teams**: 
    1. Make sure to have a team. 
    2. We want to bring together: developers, PMs, Data scientists, designers etc. 
    3. A team could be made up of engineers only or a mix of cross-discipline teammates. 
    4. We encourage freedom to innovate and be creative. 
    5. Recommended team size: 3 to 5 people.
2. **Logistics:**
    1. Slack will be the main communication channel for the event. Please use [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2) to post questions and requests. 
    2. Streaming: When there are talks or workshops, we will make sure we have a video stream available for remote participants. We will post the links in [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2).

## Challenges

The focus of the event would be in the following areas:

* Using data to analyze, understand and communicate the Venezuelan crisis.
* Digital products and platforms to connect the diaspora with the country.

1. In the `challenges` folder you will find a list of challenges proposed by our partner organizations. Please take time to review them before the event. The more prepared, the more chances your team will have of making good progress during the weekend! 
2. Each challenge will have a dedicated Slack channel where you could ask questions and get clarifications. The slack channel for a channel follows the following convention: chal-*challenge_code*. (e.g #[chal-mpv-inf](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CHEG10M7S), [#chal-mit-rea](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH875RP7T))

If you want to work on a challenge that is not by our partner organization, you are welcome to do so! Share you challenge in [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2).

Neither Code for Venezuela nor our partner organization will retain ownership of your code. Finished work should be licensed under either Apache or MIT open source licenses so that it can continue to benefit the non-profits

## Demos and Presentations

1. Each team will present a 3 minute demo on their work. 
2. You can record a video and we will present it on site as a part of the final presentations. 
3. **Deadline**: Sunday 14, 4:30pm Pacific Time.
4. **Submission process**:
    1. Use Loom to record the video of the demo: [https://www.useloom.com](https://www.useloom.com)
    2. Post your video to [Slack](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2) 
5. **Feedback**: All participants are invited to watch the feedback from our panelists. This will happen at 4:30PM PST, Sunday 14th and will be live streamed. If you can't join live, we will let you know via Slack on Monday 04/15 any feedback from our panelists.
6. **Continuity**: If your project has scope that goes beyond the weekend of the Hackathon, let us know if you would like to keep contributing. 

## Pro Tips

1. We recommend you use Trello to organize your day. 
2. We suggest participants choose just one challenge to focus on and get it 100% done (hopefully!) 
3. Ask questions using the designated Slack channel for your challenge.
4. Keep an eye out for our Zoom links that we will use to live-stream the event for participants.
5. We will send you virtual food  (üçå üçâ üçá üçì)  but you will need something real. Make sure to have enough arepas or pizza! And have enough water too ‚ò∫

## Remote participation

Join our event remotely! Do you have a team? A location? Let's do this! 

We will set up a [Slack channel to allow remote folks](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2) to participate in this event. If your location has a webcam we can discuss using Zoom to live-stream the event.
