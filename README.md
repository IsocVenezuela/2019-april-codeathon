1. **Teams**: 
    1. Make sure to have a team. 
    2. We want to bring together: developers, PMs, Data scientists, designers etc.

    4. We encourage freedom to innovate and be creative. 
    5. Team Size Recommendation: 3 to 5 people.

    6. Slack will be the main communication channel for the event. Please use [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2) to post questions and requests. 
    7. When there are talks or workshops, we will make sure we have a video stream available for remote participants.

## Challenges

1. In the `challenges` folder you will find a list of challenges proposed by our partner organizations. Please take time to review them before the event. The more prepared, the more chances your team will have of making good progress during the weekend! 
2. Each challenge will have a dedicated Slack channel where you could ask questions and get clarifications. The slack channel for a channel follows the following convention: chal-*challange_code*. (e.g #[chal-mpv-inf](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CHEG10M7S), [#chal-mit-rea](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH875RP7T))

## Demos and Presentations

2. We suggest participants choose just one challenge to focus on and get it 100% done (hopefully!) 
3. Ask questions using the designated Slack channel for your challenge.
4. Keep an eye out for our Zoom links that we will use to live-stream the event for participants.
5. We will send you virtual food  (üçå üçâ üçá üçì)  but you will need something real. Make sure to have enough arepas or pizza! And have enough water too ‚ò∫

## Remote participation

Join our event remotely! Do you have a team? A location? Let's do this! 

We will set up a [Slack channel to allow remote folks](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2) to participate in this event. If your location has a webcam we can discuss using Zoom to live-stream the event.
